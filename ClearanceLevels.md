# Clearance Levels

A security clearance is a status granted to individuals allowing them access to sensitive information. At Flow, we have three clearance levels:

  1. Public (such as the public web site, advertisements, press releases etc.): can be disseminated freely, does not require user authentication

  2. Confidential (such as internal announcements, wikis, Intranet sites content, non PCI related source code etc.): destined only for Flowâ€™s employees

  3. Top Secret (such as PCI or PII customer data, PCI related source code, sensitive reports or customer lists etc.): destined for select groups of employees, based on a job need to know; obtaining Top Secret access requires a background check

Applications can themselves be classified as Confidential or Top Secret. For example, any application touching payment card information is classified as Top Secret. This means only employees with Top Secret clearance can access those applications. The requirements for top secret clearance are documented at:
