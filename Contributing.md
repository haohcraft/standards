# Contribution Guidelines

Changes are contributed via Pull Requests in github.

Repository maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance.

The only hard rules we have:

  a. Only the author can merge their pull request. We do this as only
     the author truly knows if a pull request is ready. In addition,
     with continuous delivery, a merge is indicative of code going to
     production. We want the author to be aware of the release of
     their code.

  b. A change requires at least one LGTM from an active contributor to
     the project. For now, this is a loose definition given we all
     know who works on what. Over time, if identification of "active
     contributor" becomes a challenge, we will formalize in some
     way. Note that this means an active contributor can immediately
     merge their own pull request if they so choose. The primary value
     of the pull request in this case is notifciation to the rest of
     the team.
